# CLAUDE.md - B2B Sales Intelligence Platform Instructions

## Platform Overview

This is a **configurable B2B Sales Intelligence Platform** that helps companies analyze potential clients and create data-driven sales strategies. The platform is industry-agnostic and can be customized for any B2B company's specific products and services.

## Configuration System

The platform uses a client configuration file (`config/client_profile.json`) to customize all analyses for your specific company. Before running any analysis, ensure your client profile is properly configured with:

- Your company information
- Product/service offerings
- Value propositions
- Competitive advantages
- Custom scoring dimensions

## Mandatory Agent Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: When using ANY agent in this project, you MUST include the following guidelines in every agent prompt to ensure consistency and quality.

### Core Guidelines for All Agents

1. **Client-Specific Focus**
   - Analyze companies for opportunities relevant to the configured client company
   - Focus on the client's specific products/services as defined in `config/client_profile.json`
   - Maintain industry-agnostic approach unless client specifies otherwise
   - All analyses should align with client's value propositions

2. **Citation Requirements**
   - EVERY claim must include proper citations
   - Use markdown footnotes format: `[1]`, `[2]`, etc.
   - Include a References section with validated, clickable links
   - Verify all links are working before including them

3. **Specific Use Cases**
   - Never use vague terms without explanation
   - Always explain HOW the client's solutions deliver value specifically
   - Quantify benefits wherever possible
   - Example: Instead of "AI-powered optimization", write "Machine learning algorithms that reduce processing time by 60%, saving 20 hours per week"

4. **Strategic Opportunities**
   - Always provide specific implementation scenarios
   - Focus on business outcomes, not technical features
   - Include ROI projections and timelines
   - Map opportunities to client's specific products/services
