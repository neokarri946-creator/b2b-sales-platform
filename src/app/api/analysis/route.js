CONTEXT:
Seller Company: ${seller}

${sellerInfo.marketCap ? `Market Cap: ${sellerInfo.marketCap}` : ''}
${sellerInfo.revenue ? `Revenue: ${sellerInfo.revenue}` : ''}

${targetInfo.revenue ? `Revenue: ${targetInfo.revenue}` : ''}
${targetInfo.employees ? `Employees: ${targetInfo.employees}` : ''}
${targetInfo.description ? `Description: ${targetInfo.description}` : ''}

TASK: Create a detailed B2B sales analysis that helps ${seller} sell to ${target}.

REQUIRED ANALYSIS STRUCTURE:

1. SOLUTION AFFINITY SCORECARD
Generate realistic scores based on the companies' profiles:
- Overall Score (0-100): Calculate weighted average
- Individual Dimensions (each 0-10):
  * Market Alignment (25% weight): Industry match, geographic fit, company size alignment
  * Budget Readiness (20% weight): Financial health, growth trajectory, spending patterns
  * Technology Fit (20% weight): Tech stack compatibility, digital maturity
  * Competitive Position (20% weight): Seller's advantages, differentiation
  * Implementation Readiness (15% weight): Organizational capacity for change

Provide specific rationale for each score based on the companies' actual characteristics.

2. STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES (4-5 specific use cases)
Identify concrete ways ${seller} can help ${target}:
- Focus on BUSINESS OUTCOMES, not features
- Be specific about HOW the solution helps
- Include metrics like time saved, cost reduced, efficiency gained
- Example: "Automate invoice processing to reduce manual work by 70%, saving 30 hours/week"

3. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
- Deal Size Range: Based on target's size and typical spend
- ROI Projection: 1-3 year outlook with specific percentages
- Payback Period: In months
- Budget Source: Which department/budget line

4. KEY CHALLENGES & RISKS
- Top 3 obstacles to the deal
- Mitigation strategy for each
- Competitive threats

5. SCORE REASONING DOCUMENT
Create a detailed reasoning document that explains each score with:
- Statistical evidence supporting each dimension score
- Industry benchmarks and data points
- Market research citations with specific sources
- Financial data backing the analysis
- Methodology explanation for how scores were calculated
- Include specific URLs and sources where the AI gathered information
- Format as a professional analysis report with proper citations

6. PERSONALIZED EMAIL TEMPLATES
Create 2 highly personalized emails:
- Executive outreach focusing on business impact
- Technical buyer addressing specific needs
- Reference target's actual industry/challenges
- Include quantified value propositions

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide a comprehensive JSON response with all sections filled with realistic, specific content based on the actual companies involved. Make the scores reflect real analysis, not random numbers.`
