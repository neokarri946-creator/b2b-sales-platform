COMPATIBILITY WARNING: ${compatibilityCheck < 0.5 ? 'SEVERE INCOMPATIBILITY DETECTED - This deal is likely NON-VIABLE' : 'Assess compatibility carefully'}

Generate a realistic B2B sales analysis with:

1. If industries are incompatible (adult content â†’ enterprise, etc.):
   - Overall score: 5-20% maximum
   - All dimension scores: 1-3/10 maximum
   - Clear warnings about why partnership is impossible
   - Focus on insurmountable barriers (reputation, compliance, governance)

2. If industries are compatible:
   - Realistic scores based on actual fit
   - Normal analysis methodology

For each dimension provide:
- Score (0-10) reflecting TRUE compatibility
- Summary explaining the score
- Detailed analysis with specific reasons
- Sources and evidence

Be brutally honest about viability. Many B2B partnerships are simply impossible due to industry incompatibility, and scores must reflect this reality.
